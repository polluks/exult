Exult instructions for Mac OS X
-------------------------------


To play
-------
First you need to get Ultima 7 or Serpent Isle. Either you own
it already, or you buy it somewhere. 

In the documentation of Exult (ReadMe, ReadMe.html) we describe 
several ways of how to install the original games and where to
put the files on your Mac so Exult finds them automatically.

Now download Exult, and have fun!

More information can be found in the accompanying files README and FAQ.

How to compile on Mac OS X
--------------------------

The following guide is only for people that want to compile Exult on their own. 
This is not needed if there is a current snapshot for OS X available on our 
download page.

Make sure you have the Apple developer tools installed. They ship with
Mac OS X, but have to be installed separately. You can also download the
latest version for free from http://developer.apple.com, you must register,
though.

In order to compile Exult, you need to install several Unix packages.
If you are an expert, you may want to install them manually; for all others,
we recommend installing them via Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net) or 
MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/). 

Install these packages with Fink:
  sdl
  sdl2
  libvorbis0

Or if you use MacPorts install
  libsdl
  libsdl2
  libvorbis

Installing these packages with either Fink or MacPorts will actually
install many other packages required by these packages.
  
If you are compiling the source code from Git, as opposed to the source of
a released version, you also need to install these packages with Fink:
  automake1.15
  libtool2

(MacPorts is good, all relevant dependencies were pulled in by installing libsdl )

Open terminal and enter the following to allow the compile to find all the 
headers.

If you use Fink:
  export CFLAGS=-I/sw/include
  export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS
  export CPPFLAGS=$CFLAGS

If you use MacPorts:
  export CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include
  export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS
  export CPPFLAGS=$CFLAGS

Now you are ready to compile Exult. If you are compiling from Git, the
first thing you have to run is this:
  ./autogen.sh

The next step is the same whether you compile a release version or Git:
  ./configure
  make

This will give you a "exult" binary in the current directory. If you want
a nice Exult.app (double clickable from the Finder and all), enter this
command:
  make bundle

Be warned, the binary created this way is not static linked, that means 
if you copy it to another machine it will most likely NOT work. So you 
can only use it on your own computer (see the instructions further down 
for a static build)


How to compile Exult Studio on Mac OS X
---------------------------------------


If you want to compile Exult Studio, you have to install these packages:

If you use Fink
  gtk2

If you use MacPorts (SDL needs to be installed with the x11 dependency for Exult Studio)
  libsdl +x11
  libsdl2 +x11
  gtk2

This will cause many other packages required by gtk2 to
be installed. 

Then you need to install Xquartz from https://www.xquartz.org (because currently drag'n'drop 
between Exult Studio and Exult requires the X.org X Windows System (x11)).

After that, you have to re-run configure and make (remember to do the export commands 
to find the headers):
  ./configure --enable-exult-studio --enable-macosx-studio-support
  make

In order to use Exult Studio with Exult you will need to do:

- The nice Exult.app will not work with Exult Studio, you will need to run 
the exult binary, found where you compiled the source. 

- You need to add the path of Exult Studio to your PATH settings so that Exult 
can start Exult Studio on entering Map-Edit-Mode (ctrl+cmd+m).
Normally Exult Studio gets compiled in /path_to_the_Exult_source_code/mapedit, 
so if you do "export PATH=$PATH:/path_to_the_Exult_source_code/mapedit" before 
starting Exult, you can start using Exult and Exult Studio.
If you don't want to set the path to Exult Studio, you can also start Exult,
go into Map-Edit-Mode, start Exult Studio manually and click in it's menu
on File->Connect.

- You need to copy the file exult_studio.glade (found in 
/path_to_the_Exult_source_code/mapedit/) to your Exult data folder which is by 
default in /Library/Application Support/Exult/data.

NOTE that SDL2 version <= 2.0.5 doesn't work correctly with XQuartz, this is fixed in 
SDL2 development sources.

How to compile a static version of Exult on Mac OS X
----------------------------------------------------

If you want a version of Exult for using it on another OS X machine you need to 
compile a static version.
You need to follow the above instructions on how to compile Exult. Then you have to
re-run configure and make
  ./configure --enable-static-libraries --with-macosx-static-lib-path=path/to/static/libs
  make

Depending on whether you use Fink or MacPorts you need to enter the path to your
static libs in the configure option "--with-macosx-static-lib-path=path/to/static/libs".
For Fink it should be "--with-macosx-static-lib-path=/sw/lib".
For MacPorts "--with-macosx-static-lib-path=/opt/local/lib".

On our dowloads page we currently provide a static built snapshot of Git for 
OS X 10.4 and newer for both PowerPC and Intel machines.
Take note however that compiling a static version of Exult Studio does not work.
