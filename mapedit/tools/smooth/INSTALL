Under linux:
Normally, a simple "make && make install" should do. It will prompt
you for the root password for make install so be prepared to pass it
(files are copied to /usr/lib/).
To use clang instead of the default gcc, use "make CC=clang".

Under windows:
Use the binary package available at si-french.sf.net/tools/
If you insist on compiling on Windows, contact Ryan (see AUTHORS).

Under anything else:
I don't know. If you port it, please send me an email and a diff, so I
can update the source code (see AUTHORS for contact info).
