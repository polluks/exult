Exult instructions for Windows
------------------------------------


To play
---------
First you need to get Ultima 7 or Serpent Isle. Either you own it already, or
you buy it somewhere.  Then you must install it. Note that the Ultima Collection
already contains an installed copy of Ultima 7 (In the Ultima7 directory) and of
Serpent Isle (In the Serpent directory).

From the Ultima7 or Serpent folder on your PC, copy the STATIC sub folder to the
'blackgate' or 'serpentisle' sub folder (as appropriate) of the folder you
installed Exult in (you will likely have to create the sub folders yourself).

Run "exult.exe".
Have fun!


Notes
------
*	Exult generates the files 'stdout.txt' and 'stderr.txt' when you run it.
	These may give you some idea of what is going on under the hood. When Exult
	suddenly quits, sometimes these files can help.

*	Exult Studio generates the files 'studioout.txt' and 'studioerr.txt' when
	you run it. These may give you some idea of what is going on under the hood.
	When Exult Studio suddenly quits, sometimes these files can help.

*	If you're interested in building Exult for windows yourself, there are two
	sections below describing how. In the instructions below, reference is made
	to changing environment variables; how this is done exactly depends on the
	version of Windows you use. Here are some instructions:
	-	For Windows NT/2000:
		http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100843
	-	For Windows XP/Server/Vista:
		http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310519
	(incidentally, the XP instructions are good for all of those systems)
	-	For Windows 9x/Me:
		You have to set them in autoexec.bat using the "set" command.


To build in Windows using MSYS2/MinGW64
---------------------------------------

Download latest MSYS2:
    32-bit Windows:
        http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/msys2-i686-latest.exe
    64-bit Windows:
        http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/msys2-x86_64-latest.exe

Install it somewhere, then start it from Start Menu. Run the following command:
    pacman -Syyu --noconfirm

Reply 'Y' when you have to. At some point, you will be asked to close and reopen
the shell. Do so.

Now it is time to make a choice: whether to build Exult on 32- or 64-bit: start
the corresponding shell ("MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit" or "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit") from the
start menu. Please note that, at the time of this writing, the 64-bit Windows
version of Exult is completely untested.

When the shell starts, issue the following commands:
    pacman -S --noconfirm --needed base-devel git \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-toolchain \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-binutils \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-ntldd

This installs the toolchain for building everything. Now, you must install
the required libraries for building each component. The commands given below
assume you have not installed any of the others, and can be used independently.

To build Exult, you must install the following:
    pacman -S --noconfirm --needed \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-SDL2 \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-fluidsynth \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-libogg \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-libvorbis \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-zlib

To build the Exult tools, you must install the following:
    pacman -S --noconfirm --needed mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-SDL2_image

To build Exult Studio, you must install the following:
    pacman -S --noconfirm --needed \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-gtk2 \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-libxml2 \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-freetype \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-zlib

To build the Gimp Plug-In, you must install the following:
    pacman -S --noconfirm --needed \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-gtk2 \
            mingw-w64-${MSYSTEM_CARCH}-gimp

You now have everything needed to build any of the components you want.

    **Warning**
    The Gimp plug-in must be compiled with the same architecture of the version
    of Gimp which you use. That is: if you use 32-bit Gimp, you must compile
    the 32-bit version of the plug-in, and likewise for 64-bit Gimp.

Change to the directory where you unpacked the Exult source code.
(ie cd C:/exult)

Open Makefile.mingw from the Exult directory in a text editor and change
C:/Ultima7 to the directory you want Exult to be installed to.
(ie C:/Games/Ultima7)

You can also change C:/GimpPlugin to the direcroty you want the Gimp Plug-in
to be installed to. This depends on the version of Gimp you use:
    Gimp 2.8:
        C:/Users/<username>/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins
    Gimp 2.10 and newer:
        C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/GIMP/<version>/plug-ins

If you are compiling Exult Studio, it will be installed to the same directory
that Exult when you compile it. You can change that directory in the same way.

To compile and install Exult, type the command
    make -f Makefile.mingw install

To compile and install the Exult Tools, type the command
    make -f Makefile.mingw toolsinstall

To compile and install Exult Studio, type the command
    make -f Makefile.mingw studioinstall

To compile and install the Gimp Plug-In, type the command
    make -f Makefile.mingw plugininstall

If you want to make more than one, you can combine the commands; for example,
to build Exult and the Exult Tools, you can type the command
    make -f Makefile.mingw install toolsinstall

Once compile has finished and been installed exit MSYS2

Run Exult.exe and enjoy the game :-)

    **Windows XP Compatibility**
    There is a host of issues that prevent executables built with the above
    instructions from working on Windows XP. The easiest to get around is
    SDL2 image, which is needed by mockup and smooth tools. If you don't use
    these tools, you don't need to do anything.

    If you *do* use them, you can get them working by replacing the SDL2
    image DLLs from MSYS2 by the official ones:
        https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

    There are more problems to handle to get Exult and Exult Studio running on
    Windows XP. The first issue is that latest GLIB has dropped support for it;
    the most recent version that retains Windows XP support is 2.54.3. In the
    following, replace '/path/to/exult/source' by the actual path to Exult's
    source code, then issue the following commands:
        pacman -S --noconfirm --needed python zlib-devel \
                libffi-devel gettext-devel
        http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/sources/glib/2.54/glib-2.54.3.tar.xz
        tar -xf glib-2.54.3.tar.xz
        cd glib-2.54.3
        patch -p1 < /path/to/exult/source/win32/glib-xp.patch
        CPPFLAGS="-march=i686 -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0501" ./configure
                --prefix=$(MSYSTEM_PREFIX) --with-python=$(which python)
        make

    Once it finishes building, grab the following DLLs for Exult:
        glib/.libs/libglib-2.0-0.dll
        gmodule/.libs/libgmodule-2.0-0.dll

    Exult Studio needs the following DLLs:
        gio/.libs/libgio-2.0-0.dll
        glib/.libs/libglib-2.0-0.dll
        gmodule/.libs/libgmodule-2.0-0.dll
        gobject/.libs/libgobject-2.0-0.dll

    For Eult Studio, we will need to do a few more things. First, we need a
    version of libHarfBuzz without DWRITE support. Here is how to build it:
        wget https://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/harfbuzz-2.1.3.tar.bz2
        tar -xf harfbuzz-2.1.3.tar.bz2
        cd harfbuzz-2.1.3/
        ./configure --prefix=$(MSYSTEM_PREFIX)
        make

    Once that finishes, grab the following DLL for Exult Studio:
        src/.libs/libharfbuzz-0.dll

    And that's all: Exult, Tools, and Exult Studio will now work on Windows XP.


To build in Windows using MSVC 6.0
----------------------------------

NOTE: These instructions probably don't work anymore.
      We need to create new solutions for more modern Visual Studio
      and get Exult compiling.

1) Download SDL and ZLib for Win32/MSVC6. Add their Include and Library
directories to MSVC's Search Directories (Tools->Options->Directories).

SDL: http://www.libsdl.org/
ZLib: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

2) Set The environment variable EXULT_INSTALL_PATH to the directory where you
want the Exult binaries to be copied to when doing an Install Build. This is
optional and is only required for when doing an Install build.

3) Load the Exult Project Workspace "msvcstuff/Exult.dsw" in MSVC 6.0
(File->Load Workspace)

4) If required, enter the correct "Working Directory" in the "Debug tab" of the
Exult project settings for all Configurations.

5) Select and Build Exult using one of the 4 Configuration (Win32 Debug,
Win32 Release, Win32 Debug Install or Win32 Release Install).

6) Have Fun!


To cross-build from Linux
---------------------------
(Note: this hasn't been tested recently, and may or may not work)

Exult is originally a Linux project, using a platform
independent API called SDL. (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

Because of this, the Windows version has been built in
Linux, using the cross-compiler Mingw32.

Please note it is not necessary to build Exult yourself,
since the Windows executable is already included.

1) get and install Mingw32 and SDL.

SDL: http://www.libsdl.org/index.php

Mingw32: http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/README.txt

Installation instructions can be found on the same pages.
(make sure to get the DirectX headers, and build SDL for the cross compiler)

2) build exult:

configure --host=i386-linux --target=i386-mingw32 --enable-win32
make

3) copy exult.exe to your U7 directory, and run it from windows
If you are currently playing a game of Ultima 7, be sure
to make a backup of the gamedat directory.
 
4) Have fun :-)
